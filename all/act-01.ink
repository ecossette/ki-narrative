-   Late spring. The Laketown Docks.
    *   [- next -]

-  Troy, Alexis, Julian and Mia meet for a day of boating at the SSW edge of the Evermore Ruent Basin, a large, freshwater lake.

    *   [- next -]

-   The lake is large, covering some 22,000 square miles. Though generally placid, it has both waves and strong currents, and often suffers from sudden gusts of wind. Navigating it is a task for an experienced, safety-conscious boater.

    -   CHR_TRO_DEF
    -   Troy is the most experienced.
    -   "You don't need to worry. I grew up on the shores of Strar Lake. My brother Vincent and I spent as much time on the water as we could. I know what I'm doing!"
    Mia laughs at Troy's defensive tone.

=== intro_alexis ===
    -   CHR_ALX_DEF
    -   Alexis has a moderate level of experience.
    -   "I got my boating education certificate a few years ago. I had to, so I could drive my uncle's boat when we visited his lake cabin. So I've got the certificate <i>and</i> experience."

    -   CHR_JUL_ARO
    -   Julian has some boating experience.

    -   "OK, OK, so I've been boating just a handful of times. But I'm a really quick learner!"

=== intro_mia ===
    -   CHR_MIA_DEF
    -   "I've never been on a boat before," she says. "I skimmed a boating safety study guide last night, but I'm still a little worried."

    -   Does Mia have anything to be nervous about?
        *   No[.], her previous study will help, and she's with more experienced boaters. But she needs to stay alert, to communicate with her friends in case she has noticed something they have not, and to pay attention to the most experienced boater, Troy.
            -> intro_study_guide
        *   Yes[.], it would be better if she'd completed an official boating safety course before boating.
            -> intro_study_guide
        *   Maybe[.], but if she stays alert, wears a personal flotation device (PFD), and follows the guidance of her friends, Mia should be fine.

    -   CHR_ALX_REL
    -   Right! The length of a vessel is measured from the bow to the stern.
        * [Why is this important to know?] It is important to know the length of a boat because its length determines what equipment a vessel must have to comply with the law.

== mia_purses_cp ==
    -   CHR_MIA_REL
    -   CHR_TRO_REL
    -   Troy puts on his mock-serious captain's voice. "In the absence of capacity plates for recreational boats 20 feet and over, safe operating capacity is left to the captain's experience, judgment, and common sense." He smiles broadly. "It's fine, Mia. Trust me."
        *   [Alexis nods.] -> alx_nod_cp

== alx_nod_cp ==
    -   CHR_ALX_REL
    -   She waves an arm, emphasizing the size of the boat. "We certainly seem well within the <i>Lakesong's</i> capacity. There are only four of us."

== tro_cont_cap ==
    -   CHR_TRO_SUR
    -   "My brother has had a dozen people on the <i>Lakesong</i>, but the safe capacity isn't just a matter of what the boat should be able to handle. It also depends on conditions, and how the boat is loaded," Troy explains. "Anyone who's spent a significant amount of time on the water can tell when a boat is overloaded."

    //tweaked a little here, as the context meant it was ominous from the start, not not only now. Also added the inexperienced bit. Don't need the 'new to boating', as that's conveyed in inexperienced.

== prob_overloaded ==
    -   CHR_TRO_SAD

    // leave things like sombrely out - as if you can't convey it in the words, it'll seem odd in the description of how someone speaks. And if you can convey it, then it's a doubling up.

        // here the continuation of the sentence works a bit better. But I'd still stick to a rule of having each click being a moving thing on act, and not have it part of the next bit - or it feels a little like there's no point breaking them up.
