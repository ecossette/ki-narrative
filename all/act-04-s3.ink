// Troy and Julian returned to the cove after turning back from following the stream far enough to encounter thieves. We'll join the girls on the Lakesong. 

-   To be written: join Mia and Alexis on Lakesong as the rendezvous hour approaches and they make their way to the cove. They'll find the cove full of patchy fog such that they can't see the entire cove. They'll need to use the signal horn. As they are about to blow the signal, they hear a boat motor, but can't see a boat. They boat sound gets closer and then slowly fades in the distance. After recovering the two boys, they'll all discuss hearing this boat. Troy and Julian will tell the girls about the hidden stream. 

// randomizer needed for that girls saw as player will not have accompanied them. 

    They'll take the Lakesong back to Laketown.
