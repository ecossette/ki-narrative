    -   After successfully anchoring the <i>Lakesong</i>, Troy does another quick check for leaks.

    -   "That's good news," he says. "Taking on water is the most likely problem after running aground."
    -   "And the fog seems less thick now," says Alexis. "That's more good news!"
    -   "Agreed," says Troy. "It's still pretty thick, but I can see twice as far as I could when we first entered the fog."

        "Well, it's gone now, but I swear I caught a glimpse of a shoreline."

    -   "Our last position before we lost visibility was pretty far from shore," he says.

        "Look! There it is again," says Julian, pointing.

        "It has to be an island," says Troy.

    -   "Whatever island it is, let's go explore it!" says Alexis. "I mean, we aren't going anywhere until this fog lifts anyway. What do you think?"

            *   ["No flipping way!" says Julian.]
                -- CHR_JUL_REL
                "What if Troy's wrong and that <i>is</i> Kalkomey Isle? Getting attacked by mutant creatures is not high on my list ofâ€”of entertainment preferences!"


            *   ["We do have the paddleboards," says Troy.]
                -- CHR_TRO_REL
                "And the boat is anchored securely. As long as we don't venture too far..."

                "Not for a while," says Troy. "The fog and the overcast sky make it seem later than it really is. Still, we would need to keep an eye on the time."

== paddleboard_safety ==
    -   CHR_TRO_REL
    -   Before setting off, Troy reminds his friends about basic paddleboard safety.

        "When you're on a paddleboard, you're still a boater," says Troy. "So you need to follow the same safety practices, including wearing a PFD."

        -> on_paddeboards


== flip_go_island ==
    -   CHR_TRO_REL
    -   Because they can't agree on what to do, they decide to flip a coin.

        Troy holds up a coin. "Heads we go explore the island, and tails we stay here on the boat until the fog clears."

            * [Troy tosses the coin.]

// SND paddling
    -   Troy and Mia navigate one board, while Alexis and Julian take the other. Behind them, the Lakesong's masthead and stern lights shine brightly, acting as the all-around white light required when a boat is anchored in fog or darkness. 

            * They arrive on the small beach[.], and as they look around, a few things immediately catch their attention.

                    "Hey, this looks like an old dock hidden beneath this overgrowth," says Alexis, peeling back tree limbs.
                    "But look!" says Troy. "Parts of it are brand new."

                        ** ["Someone must be still using it," says Alexis]

                    -- CHR_JUL_REL
                    Mia sees a handle sticking out of the brush. She finds it's connected to a rake.
                    "Who would hide a rake out here?" asks Mia.
                    "Maybe to rake away footprints?" wonders Julian.
                        ** ["Eww, that's creepy," says Mia.]

                    -- CHR_MIA_REL
                    Troy finds a sign laying face-down and picks it up.

                    "What's it say?" asks Mia.
                    "Most of it is washed out," he says. "Looks like part of a logo... and the words 'GENETICS' and "FIELD STUDY."
                        ** [Julian's eyes open wide.]

                Done exploring, the friends gather at the center of the beach.

            -   "If this is Kalkomey Isle, it sure doesn't appear to be abandoned," says Troy. "Somebody's certainly been here recently."

                As the fog slowly dissipates, more of the island becomes visible.

                    * ["Look, there's a path," says Alexis.]

== path_in_woods ==
    -   CHR_ALX_SML
    -   Alexis points to a narrow footpath leading into the woods... and further into the island.

        "Let's see where that path goes!" she says.

            *   [Follow the path, since it's still too foggy to boat away from the island.]
                -> follow_the_path

    = return_boat_wait
    -   "I think we're better off returning to the boat," says Troy. "This fog appears to be burning off pretty quickly. We won't have to wait long."

            * [Mount the paddleboards to return.]
                -> mount_paddle_return_early


    = follow_the_path
    -   CHR_JUL_REL
    -   Alexis, Mia, and Troy walk toward the start of the path.

           "Hey, hold up," says Julian.  "Maybe I should stay behind to, you know, look after the boat?"



            * ["The boat will be fine," says Troy.]
                -> boat_well_anchored



   = boat_well_anchored
    -   CHR_TRO_REL
    -   CHR_JUL_REL
    -   "The <i>Lakesong</i> is well-anchored," he says. "Besides, I think it's safer if we all stick to together."

      "Well, since you put it that way, bro," says Julian, laughing nervously. "I mean, if the boat is OK and all." Julian falls into line with his friends as they walk to the start of the path.

            * [Down the path.]
                -> enter_the_path
