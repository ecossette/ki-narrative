                ** ["Sure does," says Mia.]

            "The safest thing to do now is call the marine patrol by phone, drop anchorâ€”so we don't driftâ€”and stand by with VDS to help the marine patrol locate us," says Troy. 
            
                * [Prepare for rescue.]
                After anchoring the boat and calling the marine patrol, the four friends huddle together as the rain comes down hard. The thunder makes it impossible to talk. They are wet, cold, and disappointed, especially Troy. He made a poor decision that  put them in a dangerous situation.
